WEBVTT

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We are under assault.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I repeat, we are under assault.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And yesterday, light was on.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We're more stingy than any official

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
paid by the 100-year-old Joe Poo-Karabakh.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Our first victim of the Scardis and families

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we have very concerned is here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is not a war from the repeat.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's not a war.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But hear me, and rejoice.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You may think this is suffering.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000
No, it is salvation.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Universal scales tip toward balance

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
because of your sacrifice.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Smile.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
For even in death, you have become children of sanos.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I know what it's like to lose.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Feel so desperately that you're right.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Yet to fail, nonetheless.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It's frightening.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Turns the legs to jelly.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I ask you to what end?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Dread it.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Run from it.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Destiny is a story.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It's a story.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's a story.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's a story.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's a story.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Dread it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Run from it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Destiny arrives all the same.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And now it's here.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
What should I say?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I am.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You talk too much.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The Tesseract.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Or your brother's head.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I assume you have a preference.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
No, I do.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Kill away.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Rock.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Rock.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Rock.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Rock.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Rock.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Rock.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Rock.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Rock.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We don't have the Tesseract.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It was destroyed on Asgard.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I am the worst brother.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I assure you, brother.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I assure you, brother.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.840
I assure you, brother. The sun will shine on us again.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.800
Your optimism is misplaced as God.

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.800
Well, for one thing, I'm not as guardian.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.840
And for another, we have a hope.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Let him have his fun.

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:00.939
Hetgазывla

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.339
F recognizing.

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.639
Let the dark match fall in the middle of us

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:45.459
That was a mistake

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:55.339
Oh

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:03.739
We're going to die

00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:17.739
My humble personage

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.979
Bowes before your brandia

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:27.339
No other being has ever had the might

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:30.019
Nay the nobility

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:34.339
To wield not one but two infinity stones

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:42.199
The universe lies within your grass

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:55.339
Oh

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:57.339
Oh

00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:24.099
There are two more stones on earth

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:29.259
Find the my children and bring them to me on time

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:35.179
Father we will not feed you if I might interject if you're going to earth

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.139
You might want to guide

00:07:38.299 --> 00:07:40.779
Do you have a bit of experience in that arena?

00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:46.019
If you consider fail your experience I consider experience experience

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.500
or mighty Thanos I

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:52.620
Loki

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.620
Prince of Asgard

00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:57.859
Oh

00:07:57.859 --> 00:07:59.859
Denson

00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:04.859
The rightful king of the open home

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:07.539
God of mischief

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:10.139
Do hereby pledge to you

00:08:11.179 --> 00:08:13.179

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:16.059
fidelity

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:27.979
Undying

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:33.419
You should choose your words more carefully

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.340
You

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.340
Will never be

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.340
No

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.580
Resurrection's this time

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.300
Okay

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.340

Seriously you don't have any money attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual I'll tell the guys of the deli

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:51.019

Thanos is coming

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:25.019

Yeah, okay everybody has that right that's the point. I'm trying to make it I

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:49.299
Proposed that last night I dreamt we had a kid

00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:51.579
So real

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.259
We named him after your extensor uncle. What was his name Morgan Morgan?

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.420
So you woke up and not really we were

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.240
Expecting yes, I had a dream about it was so real if you want to have a kid

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.060
You wouldn't know that

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.940
I'm glad you brought this up because it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nanopartes

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:18.500
Not helping this is detachments not a you don't need that I know I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.659
Future us and that's it just in case there's a monster in the closet. It's sitting in a shirt

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.779
You know me so well

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:29.779
You finished all my sentences

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.460
You should have shirts in your closet. Yeah

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:39.539
You know this should be no more surprises. You're gonna have nice dinner tonight show off this Harry windstone

00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:44.899
Right and we should have no more surprises ever. I should promise you. Yes. I will

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:47.899
You

00:12:48.699 --> 00:12:53.259
Tony Stark. I'm doctor Steven Strange. I need you to come with me

00:12:54.899 --> 00:13:00.699
Oh, congratulations on the wedding by the way, I'm sorry. You give it out tickets or something we need your help

00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:06.340
Look, it's not over selling it to save the fate of the universe at stake and who's we?

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:10.579
Hey, Tony Bruce

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:17.899
Okay

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:22.100
At the dawn of the universe, there was nothing

00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:31.179
Big banks and six elemental crystals hurtling across the Virgin universe

00:13:32.699 --> 00:13:37.019
His infinity stones each control an essential aspect of existence

00:13:38.539 --> 00:13:40.539
Spaces

00:13:41.059 --> 00:13:43.059
reality

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:45.419
power

00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:47.859
soul

00:13:48.099 --> 00:13:50.099
Mind

00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:53.099
and time

00:14:02.099 --> 00:14:04.099
Tell me his name again, Thanos

00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:11.659
He's a plague Tony he invades planets he takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He said Loki

00:14:13.059 --> 00:14:15.219
Detect on New York that's him

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:27.579
What's our timeline no telling he has the power and space stones that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe if he gets his hands on all six stones

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:31.500
Tony you could destroy life on a scale hitherto on dreamt on

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.059
It's just seriously just a hitherto on dreamt of seriously leaning on the call during the cosmos

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:42.059
I'm going to allow then

00:14:44.059 --> 00:14:47.259
If Thanos needs all six why don't we just stick this one down a garbage disposal?

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:51.359
No, can do we swore on oath to protect the time stone with our lives

00:14:51.359 --> 00:14:56.779
And I swear I've dairy, but then Ben and Jerry's named a flavor after me. So start craving his lips not been

00:14:57.459 --> 00:15:04.500
Chucky I have got whole good burning fudge as I've favorite that's a thing whatever point is things change our oath to protect the time stone

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.619
Cannot change and this stone may be the best chance we have against them

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:14.820
So conversely it may also be his best chance against us. So if we don't do our jobs. What is your job exactly besides making blue and animals?

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:19.539
Protecting your reality. Do you back? Okay guys?

00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:24.779
We can quit table is discussion right now. The fact is is that we have this stone. We know where it is

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.659
Vision is out there somewhere with the mind stone and we have to find him now

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:35.100
Yeah, that's the thing. What do you mean two weeks ago vision turned off his transponder?

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.580
He's offline what?

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:43.620
Tony you lost another super bot didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving who could find vision

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.700
Probably Steve Rogers. Oh, right maybe

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.940
But

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.139
Call

00:15:59.139 --> 00:16:01.139
It's not that easy

00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:07.899
God we haven't caught up in a spell have we oh the Avengers broke up. We're toast broke up

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:13.620
Like a band like like the Beatles kept my fellow hard

00:16:15.139 --> 00:16:17.139
We're not as big in terms

00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:19.779
Tony listen to me

00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:23.379
For God

00:16:24.419 --> 00:16:27.340
Bad house is coming it doesn't matter who you're talking to or not

00:16:31.139 --> 00:16:33.139
You

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.580
You

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.500
Say doc you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair would you?

00:17:10.019 --> 00:17:12.019
Not at the moment now

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.980
No

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:58.860
Here

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.380
The

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.380
I got you on you.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.660
I need you to concentrate

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.259
Shit, we're all gonna die!

00:18:31.259 --> 00:18:32.860
There's a space ship!

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.259
We're gonna die!

00:18:34.259 --> 00:18:36.259
Yeah!

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:44.060
What's the matter with you kids?

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.060
You've never seen a spaceship before?

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:53.059
Right, he's at anyone's south of 43rd Street.

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:55.059
Notify 3rd responders.

00:18:55.059 --> 00:18:56.059
We'll do.

00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:21.059
You're the only one who can't get out of here.

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:26.059
You're the only one who can't get out of here.

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:31.059
You're the only one who can't get out of here.

00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:36.059
Give me every choice.

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:40.059
You are about to die the hands of the children of Thanos.

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:41.059
Yes, sir.

00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:45.059
Be thankful that your meaningless lives are now contributing to the power of Earth.

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:48.059
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:51.059
You better pack it up and get out of here.

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:53.059
Stuntie, but...

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:55.059
Does this chattering animals speak for you?

00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:57.059
Certainly not, I speak for myself.

00:19:57.059 --> 00:20:01.059
I could trust passing in this city and on this planet.

00:20:01.059 --> 00:20:03.059
He needs to get lost, Squidward.

00:20:03.059 --> 00:20:04.059
He exudes to me.

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:06.059
Bring me the stone.

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:07.059
Oh, shit.

00:20:07.059 --> 00:20:09.059
Do you want to piece?

00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:13.059
No, not really, but wouldn't do ever give it all on it.

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:15.059
That's right.

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:16.059
God!

00:20:16.059 --> 00:20:18.059
Been a while.

00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:20.059
It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.

00:20:20.059 --> 00:20:21.059
I just...

00:20:21.059 --> 00:20:23.059
I need God to try to have fun, so I can...

00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:25.059
Come on, come on, Max.

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:28.059
God!

00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:30.059
Where's your gun?

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:32.059
I don't know, it's never gonna be having a thing.

00:20:32.059 --> 00:20:33.059
It's no time for a thing.

00:20:33.059 --> 00:20:34.059
No, I don't mind.

00:20:34.059 --> 00:20:35.059
That's the thing right there.

00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:36.059
Let's go.

00:20:36.059 --> 00:20:37.059
Shag!

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:40.059
Yeah!

00:20:41.059 --> 00:20:43.059
Dude, you're embarrassing me for no reason.

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:45.059
Sorry, either I can't or he won't.

00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:46.059
It's okay.

00:20:46.059 --> 00:20:47.059
Stand down.

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:48.059
Keep going on him.

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:49.059
Thank you.

00:20:49.059 --> 00:20:51.059
I have to hold him.

00:21:10.059 --> 00:21:20.059
Where'd that come from?

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:21.059
It's Nanotech.

00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:22.059
You like it?

00:21:22.059 --> 00:21:25.059
You're a little soft, man.

00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:26.059
You got a good one, you got a good one.

00:21:26.059 --> 00:21:29.059
Your battery, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us.

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:30.059
Go!

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:32.059
Go!

00:21:32.059 --> 00:21:34.059
Go!

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:39.059
You gotta get that stone out of here now.

00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:41.059
It stays with me.

00:21:41.059 --> 00:21:42.059
Exactly.

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:44.059
Bye.

00:21:52.059 --> 00:21:53.059
Tony, you okay?

00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:54.059
How are we doing?

00:21:54.059 --> 00:21:55.059
Good, Pat?

00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:56.059
Really, really good.

00:21:56.059 --> 00:21:57.059
You plan on helping out?

00:21:57.059 --> 00:21:59.059
I'm trying, you don't come out.

00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:01.059
Come on.

00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:07.059
Come on!

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:09.059
What are you doing to me?

00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:10.059
Come on!

00:22:10.059 --> 00:22:11.059
Come on!

00:22:11.059 --> 00:22:12.059
Come on!

00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:13.059
Come on!

00:22:13.059 --> 00:22:14.059
Come on!

00:22:14.059 --> 00:22:15.059
Come on!

00:22:15.059 --> 00:22:22.059
What do you mean no?

00:22:28.059 --> 00:22:29.059
Hey, man.

00:22:29.059 --> 00:22:30.059
What's up, Mr. Stark?

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:31.059
Kid, where'd you come from?

00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:32.059
A field trip.

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:33.059
Come on!

00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:37.059
What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

00:22:37.059 --> 00:22:38.059
He's from space.

00:22:38.059 --> 00:22:40.059
He came here to steal a necklace from me with wizard.

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:42.059
Let me drop him.

00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:44.059
Let me go!

00:23:02.059 --> 00:23:08.059
Well, how is that quick?

00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:11.059
You must be popular with the children.

00:23:11.059 --> 00:23:15.059
It's a simple spell, but quite unbreakable.

00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:18.059
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:25.059
You're fired.

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:33.059
Removing a dead man's spell.

00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:34.059
Trouble some.

00:23:34.059 --> 00:23:38.059
You'll only wish you a day.

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:50.059
No!

00:23:53.059 --> 00:23:54.059
Kid, that's the wizard.

00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:55.059
Get on him.

00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:56.059
Money!

00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:05.059
Not good.

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:11.059
Got you!

00:24:11.059 --> 00:24:13.059
Oh, thanks!

00:24:13.059 --> 00:24:21.059
Stork!

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:23.059
I'm Beam Beam Daps.

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:25.059
Hang on, kid.

00:24:25.059 --> 00:24:27.059
Go!

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:30.059
Go!

00:24:30.059 --> 00:24:33.059
Go!

00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:36.059
Go!

00:24:36.059 --> 00:24:38.059
Go!

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:41.059
Go!

00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:41.559
Whoa!

00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:45.659
Longer invited to my wedding.

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:55.059
Maybe a little juice Friday.

00:25:03.859 --> 00:25:05.259
Unlocked 17A.

00:25:11.059 --> 00:25:13.059
He got a let go. I'm gonna catch you.

00:25:13.059 --> 00:25:15.059
You said save the wizard!

00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:16.059
I can't breathe.

00:25:16.059 --> 00:25:19.059
We're too high up. You're running out of air.

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:20.059
Yeah.

00:25:20.059 --> 00:25:22.059
Let me see.

00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:43.059
Oh!

00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:49.059
Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here.

00:25:49.059 --> 00:25:51.059
Having trail scan? Friday's at a mall.

00:25:51.059 --> 00:25:52.059
Yep.

00:25:52.059 --> 00:25:54.059
Oh, come on!

00:26:02.059 --> 00:26:04.059
Boss, aim coming call from Miss Pots.

00:26:04.059 --> 00:26:05.059
Tony?

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:06.059
Oh my god, I need more right.

00:26:06.059 --> 00:26:07.059
What's going on?

00:26:07.059 --> 00:26:10.059
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our A30 Res.

00:26:10.059 --> 00:26:13.059
Just cut us all probably not make it back for a while.

00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:16.059
Tony, I'm not on that ship.

00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:17.059
Yeah.

00:26:17.059 --> 00:26:18.059
God, I'm not pleased.

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:20.059
Honey, I'm sorry.

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:22.059
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're saying.

00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:23.059
Cut.

00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:24.059
Cut.

00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:25.059
Right now.

00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:26.059
Back.

00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:28.059
Boss, we're doing the turn.

00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:30.059
I'm going to.

00:26:40.059 --> 00:26:42.059
Oh my god.

00:26:45.059 --> 00:26:48.059
Oh, I should've stayed on the bus.

00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:03.059
Where you going?

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:05.059
Times don't spin ticket.

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:07.059
Sack them remains unguarded.

00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:09.059
What will you do?

00:27:09.059 --> 00:27:11.059
I'm going to make a call.

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:36.059
Got speed to move into this.

00:27:37.059 --> 00:27:39.059
That's not the man off the ground.

00:27:39.059 --> 00:27:42.059
You lift it in well.

00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:45.059
At the sky on the Indianian.

00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:47.059
Come on, get with me.

00:27:47.059 --> 00:27:50.059
Hey, yo, man, you sound for the rubber band.

00:27:50.059 --> 00:27:53.059
Man, you think I'm dead?

00:27:53.059 --> 00:27:55.059
You think I'm dead?

00:27:55.059 --> 00:27:57.059
I'm such a savior, man.

00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:02.059
You're bound to risk of trouble when the rubber band stops the jam.

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:05.059
Why are we doing this again?

00:28:05.059 --> 00:28:07.059
It's a distress signal rocket.

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:08.059
Someone could be dying.

00:28:08.059 --> 00:28:10.059
I get that, but why are we doing it?

00:28:10.059 --> 00:28:12.059
Because we're nice.

00:28:12.059 --> 00:28:15.059
Maybe whoever it is will give us a little chick a cheese for our average.

00:28:15.059 --> 00:28:16.059
Which isn't the point.

00:28:16.059 --> 00:28:18.059
Which isn't the point.

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:20.059
I mean, if he doesn't pony up.

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:21.059
You take his shoe.

00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:22.059
Exactly.

00:28:22.059 --> 00:28:23.059
Bingo.

00:28:23.059 --> 00:28:24.059
All right.

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:28.059
We are arriving.

00:28:28.059 --> 00:28:30.059
All right, Guardians.

00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:35.059
Don't forget this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces.

00:28:40.059 --> 00:28:41.059
Group, put that thing away.

00:28:41.059 --> 00:28:43.059
Now, I don't want to tell you again.

00:28:43.059 --> 00:28:44.059
Group.

00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:45.059
And?

00:28:45.059 --> 00:28:46.059
Group.

00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:47.059
Oh, wait.

00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:48.059
Hey.

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:50.059
You got some acorns on you, kid.

00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:53.059
Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total de-home.

00:28:53.059 --> 00:28:54.059
Now keep it up.

00:28:54.059 --> 00:28:57.059
And I'm going to smash that thing to faces.

00:29:01.059 --> 00:29:03.059
What happened?

00:29:09.059 --> 00:29:11.059
Oh, my God.

00:29:16.059 --> 00:29:18.059
Looks like we're not getting paid.

00:29:18.059 --> 00:29:20.059
Oh, my God!

00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:21.059
My first!

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:22.059
My first!

00:29:22.059 --> 00:29:23.059
Get it off!

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:33.059
How the hell is this dude still alive?

00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:35.059
He is not a dude.

00:29:35.059 --> 00:29:37.059
You're a dude.

00:29:37.059 --> 00:29:38.059
This...

00:29:38.059 --> 00:29:40.059
This is a man.

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:43.059
I had some muscular man.

00:29:43.059 --> 00:29:44.059
I'm muscular.

00:29:44.059 --> 00:29:45.059
Who are you kidding?

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:47.059
Well, you won sandwich away from fat.

00:29:47.059 --> 00:29:48.059
Yeah, right.

00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:49.059
It's true.

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:50.059
You have to put away...

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:51.059
What?

00:29:53.059 --> 00:29:55.059
Come on, do you think I'm...

00:29:57.059 --> 00:29:59.059
He's anxious.

00:29:59.059 --> 00:30:01.059
Angry?

00:30:01.059 --> 00:30:04.059
He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

00:30:04.059 --> 00:30:07.059
He's like a pirate and had a baby with an angel.

00:30:07.059 --> 00:30:09.059
Wow.

00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:10.059
Is there a real wake up call for me?

00:30:10.059 --> 00:30:11.059
Okay.

00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:12.059
I'm going to get a boflex.

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:13.059
I'm going to commit.

00:30:13.059 --> 00:30:15.059
I'm going to get some dumbbells.

00:30:15.059 --> 00:30:16.059
You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

00:30:16.059 --> 00:30:19.059
It's like his muscles are made of cutotty metal fibers.

00:30:19.059 --> 00:30:21.059
Stop massaging his muscles.

00:30:23.059 --> 00:30:25.059
Wake him up.

00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:28.059
Wake?

00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:31.059
No! No, no, no!

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:48.059
What the hell are you guys?

00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:54.059
The entire time on Youth Thanos, he only ever had one goal.

00:30:55.059 --> 00:30:58.059
To bring balance to the universe by wiping out half of all life.

00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:03.059
He used to kill people planted by planet, massacre by massacre.

00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:05.059
Including my own.

00:31:05.059 --> 00:31:09.059
If he gets all six infinity stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.

00:31:10.059 --> 00:31:12.059
You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:17.059
Kamora, listen to daughter of Thanos.

00:31:20.059 --> 00:31:23.059
Your father killed my brother.

00:31:23.059 --> 00:31:24.059
Oh boy.

00:31:24.059 --> 00:31:25.059
Stepfather.

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:28.059
Technically, she hates him as much as you do.

00:31:32.059 --> 00:31:33.059
Foulness can be tough.

00:31:33.059 --> 00:31:37.059
Before my father died, he told me that I had a half sister.

00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:39.059
Was he imprisoned in hell?

00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:44.059
Then she returned home and stopped me in the eye, so I had to kill her.

00:31:44.059 --> 00:31:46.059
That's life that was nice.

00:31:46.059 --> 00:31:48.059
Round and round.

00:31:48.059 --> 00:31:49.059
I feel the pain.

00:31:49.059 --> 00:31:51.059
I feel your pain as well.

00:31:51.059 --> 00:31:54.059
Because, I mean, it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot.

00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:58.059
My father killed my mother, and then I had to kill my father.

00:31:58.059 --> 00:31:59.059
And that was hard.

00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:02.059
Probably even harder than having to kill a sister.

00:32:02.059 --> 00:32:05.059
Plus I came out with both my eyes.

00:32:05.059 --> 00:32:06.059
Which was a pain in the hell.

00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:08.059
I'm not a spiel man.

00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:10.059
How do I open this thing?

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:12.059
That's some sort of a...

00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:14.059
A four-digit code, maybe.

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:16.059
They've been birthday to me.

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:17.059
What are you doing?

00:32:17.059 --> 00:32:18.059
Taking your pod.

00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:21.059
No, you're not.

00:32:23.059 --> 00:32:24.059
You're not.

00:32:24.059 --> 00:32:27.059
You're taking our pod today, sir.

00:32:29.059 --> 00:32:32.059
Well, are you making your voice deeper?

00:32:33.059 --> 00:32:34.059
No, you are.

00:32:34.059 --> 00:32:36.059
You're entertaining the god, man.

00:32:37.059 --> 00:32:38.059
It's weird.

00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:39.059
Oh, I'm not.

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:40.059
He just did it again.

00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:41.059
This is my voice.

00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:44.059
You're mocking me.

00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:46.059
Are you mocking me?

00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:48.059
Stop it, you just did it again.

00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:50.059
He's trying to copy me.

00:32:50.059 --> 00:32:52.059
I mean, it just sucks to know he's doing it first.

00:32:52.059 --> 00:32:54.059
We need to stop Thanos.

00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:56.059
Which means we need to find out where he's going next.

00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:57.059
No, uh...

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:00.059
He must be going somewhere.

00:33:00.059 --> 00:33:02.059
No, no, nowhere.

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:04.059
It's a place we've been there.

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:05.059
Sucks.

00:33:05.059 --> 00:33:06.059
Excuse me, that's our food.

00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:07.059
Nothing more.

00:33:07.059 --> 00:33:09.059
Thor, why would he go to nowhere?

00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:13.059
Because for years, the reality stones have been safely stored.

00:33:13.059 --> 00:33:15.059
They're with a man called the collector.

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:17.059
If it's with the collector, then it's not safe.

00:33:17.059 --> 00:33:19.059
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

00:33:19.059 --> 00:33:20.059
Or a genius.

00:33:20.059 --> 00:33:23.059
How do you know he's not going for one of the other stones?

00:33:23.059 --> 00:33:25.059
There are six stones out there.

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:29.059
Thanos already has the power stone because he stole it last week.

00:33:29.059 --> 00:33:31.059
He decimated Zanda.

00:33:31.059 --> 00:33:33.059
He stole it last week.

00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:35.059
He stole it last week.

00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:36.059
He decimated Zanda.

00:33:36.059 --> 00:33:38.059
He stole the space stone from me.

00:33:38.059 --> 00:33:41.059
When he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half of my people.

00:33:41.059 --> 00:33:44.059
The time and mine stones are safe on Earth that were with the Avengers.

00:33:44.059 --> 00:33:45.059
The Avengers?

00:33:45.059 --> 00:33:47.059
The Earth's my dearest heroes.

00:33:47.059 --> 00:33:48.059
Like Kevin Bacon?

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:49.059
Maybe he may be on the team.

00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:51.059
I don't know. I haven't been there in a while.

00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:53.059
As for the soul stone, we'll know once I've seen that.

00:33:53.059 --> 00:33:55.059
No one even knows where it is.

00:33:55.059 --> 00:33:57.059
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

00:33:57.059 --> 00:33:58.059
Therefore he's going to nowhere.

00:33:58.059 --> 00:34:01.059
Hence he'll be getting the reality stone.

00:34:01.059 --> 00:34:02.059
You're welcome.

00:34:02.059 --> 00:34:04.059
Then we have to go to nowhere now.

00:34:04.059 --> 00:34:05.059
Wrong.

00:34:05.059 --> 00:34:08.059
What we have to go is never to live.

00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:09.059
That's a made-up word.

00:34:09.059 --> 00:34:10.059
All words made-up.

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:11.059
Medieval era is real.

00:34:11.059 --> 00:34:12.059
Seriously?

00:34:12.059 --> 00:34:14.059
I mean, that place is a legend.

00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:16.059
They make the most powerful horrific weapons.

00:34:16.059 --> 00:34:18.059
They've been told that the universe.

00:34:18.059 --> 00:34:20.059
I would very much like the golet, please.

00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:23.059
The rabbit is correct and clearly the smartest among you.

00:34:23.059 --> 00:34:24.059
Right.

00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:26.059
Only each of you the dwarf can make me the weapon I need.

00:34:26.059 --> 00:34:28.059
But she'll be on the captain, sir.

00:34:28.059 --> 00:34:29.059
You're very perceptive.

00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:30.059
You seem like a noble leader.

00:34:30.059 --> 00:34:32.059
Will you join me on my quest in the middle of the live?

00:34:32.059 --> 00:34:34.059
Let me just ask the captain.

00:34:34.059 --> 00:34:35.059
Wait a second.

00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:36.059
It's me.

00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:37.059
Yeah, I'll go.

00:34:37.059 --> 00:34:38.059
Wonderful.

00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:39.059
Except for that I'm the captain.

00:34:39.059 --> 00:34:40.059
Quiet.

00:34:40.059 --> 00:34:41.059
That's my backpack.

00:34:41.059 --> 00:34:42.059
Go sit down.

00:34:42.059 --> 00:34:43.059
Look, this is my ship.

00:34:43.059 --> 00:34:46.059
And I'm not going to...

00:34:46.059 --> 00:34:48.059
What kind of weapon are we talking about here?

00:34:48.059 --> 00:34:50.059
The Thanos killing kind.

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:52.059
Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

00:34:52.059 --> 00:34:53.059
No.

00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:54.059
You should be locked to strength.

00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:57.059
The will of the new bodies would crumble as your minds collapsed into madness.

00:34:57.059 --> 00:34:59.059
Is it weird that I want to do it even more now?

00:34:59.059 --> 00:35:00.059
A little bit.

00:35:00.059 --> 00:35:03.059
If we don't go to nowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone,

00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:05.059
he'll be too powerful to stop.

00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:06.059
You already is.

00:35:06.059 --> 00:35:07.059
I gotta figure it out.

00:35:07.059 --> 00:35:10.059
We got two ships and a largest saunman of morons.

00:35:10.059 --> 00:35:13.059
So me and Groop will go with the pirate angel here.

00:35:13.059 --> 00:35:16.059
And the morons will go to nowhere to try to stop Thanos.

00:35:16.059 --> 00:35:17.059
Cool?

00:35:17.059 --> 00:35:18.059
Cool.

00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:19.059
So cool.

00:35:19.059 --> 00:35:20.059
For the record?

00:35:20.059 --> 00:35:23.059
I know that you're only going with him because it's worth Thanos, isn't it?

00:35:23.059 --> 00:35:28.059
You know, you really shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:30.059
Come on, Groop.

00:35:30.059 --> 00:35:31.059
Put that game down.

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:33.059
You're right, you're brain.

00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:39.059
Did you fare well and good luck, morons?

00:35:39.059 --> 00:35:40.059
Bye.

00:35:55.059 --> 00:35:56.059
Fizz?

00:35:56.059 --> 00:35:59.059
Is it the stone again?

00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:01.059
It's as if it's speaking to me.

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:03.059
What does it say?

00:36:03.059 --> 00:36:05.059
I don't know.

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:06.059
I don't know.

00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:08.059
It's something.

00:36:08.059 --> 00:36:10.059
Hey.

00:36:19.059 --> 00:36:22.059
Tell me what you feel.

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:31.059
I just feel you.

00:36:40.059 --> 00:36:42.059
So there's a 10 a.m. to Earth.

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:44.059
The last nose would give us one time together before he went back.

00:36:44.059 --> 00:36:46.059
What if I missed that trick?

00:36:46.059 --> 00:36:47.059
There's an 11.

00:36:47.059 --> 00:36:49.059
What if I missed all the trials?

00:36:51.059 --> 00:36:53.059
One of this time I didn't go back.

00:36:53.059 --> 00:36:54.059
I think you gave Stark your word.

00:36:54.059 --> 00:36:56.059
You were out to give it to you.

00:36:56.059 --> 00:36:58.059
One of their people are expecting to be true.

00:36:58.059 --> 00:36:59.059
Both me promises.

00:36:59.059 --> 00:37:01.059
Not to each other.

00:37:01.059 --> 00:37:07.059
One, two years, we storm these moments, trying to see if this could work.

00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:09.059
I don't know.

00:37:09.059 --> 00:37:12.059
You know what I'm just going to speak for myself.

00:37:12.059 --> 00:37:15.059
I think it works.

00:37:15.059 --> 00:37:17.059
It works.

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:21.059
Stay.

00:37:21.059 --> 00:37:23.059
Stay with me.

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:26.059
I'm not.

00:37:26.059 --> 00:37:29.059
If I'm overstepping.

00:37:35.059 --> 00:37:38.059
What are they?

00:37:38.059 --> 00:37:41.059
What the storm was warning me about.

00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:44.059
I have to go.

00:37:44.059 --> 00:37:46.059
Vision.

00:37:46.059 --> 00:37:51.059
Vision, if that's true, then maybe going isn't the best idea.

00:37:51.059 --> 00:37:53.059
One, two.

00:37:53.059 --> 00:37:55.059
No!

00:37:55.059 --> 00:37:56.059
Vision.

00:37:56.059 --> 00:37:59.059
Vision, if that's true, then maybe going isn't the best idea.

00:37:59.059 --> 00:38:01.059
One, two.

00:38:01.059 --> 00:38:03.059
No!

00:38:03.059 --> 00:38:05.059
No!

00:38:06.059 --> 00:38:08.059
No!

00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:17.059
No!

00:38:18.059 --> 00:38:20.059
No!

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:35.059
The play, it stopped me from facing.

00:38:35.059 --> 00:38:37.059
Is that even possible?

00:38:37.059 --> 00:38:39.059
I wasn't supposed to be.

00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:41.059
I was just so happy.

00:38:41.059 --> 00:38:45.059
I'm beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.

00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:48.059
Right!

00:38:56.059 --> 00:39:00.059
Give up this stone and she lives.

00:39:15.059 --> 00:39:18.059
No!

00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:41.059
Hands off.

00:39:46.059 --> 00:39:49.059
Oh!

00:39:56.059 --> 00:39:58.059
Come on.

00:39:58.059 --> 00:40:00.059
You gotta get up.

00:40:00.059 --> 00:40:02.059
Come on.

00:40:02.059 --> 00:40:05.059
We have to go.

00:40:05.059 --> 00:40:08.059
Please, let go.

00:40:08.059 --> 00:40:11.059
You asked me to stay.

00:40:11.059 --> 00:40:14.059
I'm saying, please.

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:17.059
Get up.

00:41:17.059 --> 00:41:20.059
Again.

00:41:20.059 --> 00:41:23.059
We don't want to kill you, but we will.

00:41:23.059 --> 00:41:26.059
You'll never get the chance again.

00:41:46.059 --> 00:41:48.059
Can you stand?

00:41:52.059 --> 00:41:55.059
Thank you, guys.

00:41:56.059 --> 00:41:59.059
Let's go, Janice.

00:42:02.059 --> 00:42:05.059
My thought, we had a deal.

00:42:05.059 --> 00:42:08.059
Stay close, check in.

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:10.059
Don't take any chances.

00:42:10.059 --> 00:42:11.059
I'm sorry.

00:42:11.059 --> 00:42:14.059
We just wanted time.

00:42:15.059 --> 00:42:18.059
Where are two of them?

00:42:18.059 --> 00:42:21.059
Oh.

00:42:21.059 --> 00:42:24.059
We'll be safe.

00:42:24.059 --> 00:42:27.059
We'll be safe.

00:42:46.059 --> 00:42:49.059
Mother!

00:42:49.059 --> 00:42:52.059
Choose a side or die.

00:42:52.059 --> 00:42:55.059
One side is a revelation.

00:42:55.059 --> 00:42:59.059
We're from another and all night now, only to a few.

00:42:59.059 --> 00:43:01.059
What's wrong, little one?

00:43:01.059 --> 00:43:03.059
My mother.

00:43:03.059 --> 00:43:07.059
Where is my mother?

00:43:07.059 --> 00:43:11.059
What's your name?

00:43:12.059 --> 00:43:15.059
The moron?

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:18.059
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

00:43:18.059 --> 00:43:20.059
Come.

00:43:20.059 --> 00:43:23.059
Let me help you.

00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:26.059
Look.

00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:29.059
I'm sorry.

00:43:29.059 --> 00:43:32.059
I'm sorry.

00:43:32.059 --> 00:43:35.059
I'm sorry.

00:43:35.059 --> 00:43:38.059
I'm sorry.

00:43:38.059 --> 00:43:41.059
Look.

00:43:41.059 --> 00:43:45.059
Pretty, isn't it?

00:43:45.059 --> 00:43:47.059
Perfectly balanced.

00:43:47.059 --> 00:43:56.059
This whole thing should be too much to one side or the other.

00:43:56.059 --> 00:43:59.059
Here.

00:43:59.059 --> 00:44:02.059
You try.

00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:07.059
Now, go ahead and meet your maker.

00:44:09.059 --> 00:44:14.059
I'm losing track.

00:44:15.059 --> 00:44:18.059
Mmm.

00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:21.059
I got it.

00:44:28.059 --> 00:44:31.059
Gamora.

00:44:31.059 --> 00:44:34.059
Do you know what these grenades are to blow off your junk kind or the gas kind?

00:44:35.059 --> 00:44:38.059
Because I was thinking my hanging a couple on my belt right here.

00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:40.059
I don't want to.

00:44:40.059 --> 00:44:43.059
I ain't to ask a favor.

00:44:43.059 --> 00:44:46.059
Yeah, sure.

00:44:46.059 --> 00:44:50.059
One way or another, the path that we're on needs to Thanos.

00:44:50.059 --> 00:44:54.059
Which is what the grenades are for.

00:44:54.059 --> 00:44:56.059
No, I'm sorry.

00:44:56.059 --> 00:44:59.059
What's the favor?

00:44:59.059 --> 00:45:03.059
If things go wrong, if Thanos gets me.

00:45:05.059 --> 00:45:08.059
I want you to promise me.

00:45:08.059 --> 00:45:10.059
You'll kill me.

00:45:10.059 --> 00:45:13.059
What?

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:18.059
I know something he doesn't.

00:45:19.059 --> 00:45:23.059
If he finds it out, the entire universe could be at risk.

00:45:23.059 --> 00:45:25.059
What do you know?

00:45:25.059 --> 00:45:29.059
If I tell you you'd know too.

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:33.059
If it's so important, shouldn't I?

00:45:33.059 --> 00:45:35.059
I'll leave you what I'm dying.

00:45:35.059 --> 00:45:38.059
What is somebody always have to die in this area?

00:45:38.059 --> 00:45:41.059
Just...

00:45:41.059 --> 00:45:43.059
Trust me.

00:45:43.059 --> 00:45:45.059
You possibly kill me.

00:45:45.059 --> 00:45:48.059
I mean, I'd like to.

00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:51.059
I really would.

00:45:51.059 --> 00:45:54.059
Swarding me.

00:45:54.059 --> 00:45:57.059
Swarding me on your mother.

00:45:57.059 --> 00:46:02.059
Okay.

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:07.059
Okay.

00:46:07.059 --> 00:46:12.059
Okay.

00:46:12.059 --> 00:46:17.059
Oh, dude.

00:46:17.059 --> 00:46:21.059
How long have you been standing there?

00:46:21.059 --> 00:46:23.059
An hour.

00:46:23.059 --> 00:46:26.059
An hour?

00:46:26.059 --> 00:46:28.059
Are you serious?

00:46:28.059 --> 00:46:33.059
I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still.

00:46:33.059 --> 00:46:37.059
And I've become invisible to him.

00:46:37.059 --> 00:46:40.059
Watching.

00:46:40.059 --> 00:46:43.059
You're eating his argnut.

00:46:43.059 --> 00:46:46.059
But my movement.

00:46:46.059 --> 00:46:50.059
I'm so slow that it's imperceptible.

00:46:50.059 --> 00:46:55.059
I'm sure I'm invisible.

00:46:55.059 --> 00:46:58.059
Hi, Drax.

00:46:58.059 --> 00:47:01.059
Hey.

00:47:07.059 --> 00:47:11.059
This place looks deserted.

00:47:11.059 --> 00:47:15.059
Can we do movement?

00:47:15.059 --> 00:47:17.059
The third quadrature.

00:47:17.059 --> 00:47:20.059
Yeah, picking that up too.

00:47:20.059 --> 00:47:23.059
Let's put down over here.

00:47:24.059 --> 00:47:27.059
This place looks deserted.

00:47:27.059 --> 00:47:29.059
Can we do movement?

00:47:29.059 --> 00:47:31.059
The third quadrature.

00:47:31.059 --> 00:47:34.059
Yeah, picking that up too.

00:47:34.059 --> 00:47:37.059
Let's put down over here.

00:47:37.059 --> 00:47:42.059
Okay.

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:46.059
Everyone will get to see an ocean.

00:47:46.059 --> 00:47:51.059
There's a fine where any of the slightest trick into your pathetic collection.

00:47:51.059 --> 00:47:54.059
I know you have the reality.

00:47:54.059 --> 00:47:58.059
I know you have the reality.

00:47:58.059 --> 00:48:01.059
I know you have the reality.

00:48:01.059 --> 00:48:04.059
I know you have the reality.

00:48:04.059 --> 00:48:06.059
I know you have the reality.

00:48:06.059 --> 00:48:09.059
I know you have the reality.

00:48:09.059 --> 00:48:15.059
Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:18.059
I told you.

00:48:18.059 --> 00:48:22.059
I sold it.

00:48:22.059 --> 00:48:24.059
Why would I lie?

00:48:24.059 --> 00:48:27.059
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

00:48:27.059 --> 00:48:29.059
Like suicide.

00:48:29.059 --> 00:48:31.059
You do understand.

00:48:31.059 --> 00:48:34.059
Not even you surrender something so precious.

00:48:34.059 --> 00:48:37.059
I didn't know what it was.

00:48:37.059 --> 00:48:40.059
I knew what a show that I took you for.

00:48:40.059 --> 00:48:43.059
It's a last chance I'll go.

00:48:43.059 --> 00:48:46.059
Where's the stone?

00:48:46.059 --> 00:48:48.059
Today.

00:48:48.059 --> 00:48:52.059
He pays for the dust of my wife and daughter.

00:48:52.059 --> 00:48:55.059
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:48:56.059 --> 00:48:58.059
It doesn't pass.

00:48:58.059 --> 00:49:01.059
There's no stone yet.

00:49:01.059 --> 00:49:02.059
We get it.

00:49:02.059 --> 00:49:04.059
Then we can stop him.

00:49:04.059 --> 00:49:07.059
We have to get the stone first.

00:49:07.059 --> 00:49:10.059
Yeah.

00:49:10.059 --> 00:49:11.059
No.

00:49:11.059 --> 00:49:12.059
No.

00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:13.059
For a vet.

00:49:13.059 --> 00:49:15.059
For a chumeria.

00:49:15.059 --> 00:49:18.059
Sleep.

00:49:26.059 --> 00:49:29.059
Okay.

00:49:29.059 --> 00:49:30.059
Come on.

00:49:30.059 --> 00:49:34.059
Mantis, you go right.

00:49:34.059 --> 00:49:37.059
The other right.

00:49:37.059 --> 00:49:39.059
You.

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:59.059
Why?

00:50:05.059 --> 00:50:09.059
Why are you?

00:50:09.059 --> 00:50:12.059
Don't.

00:50:12.059 --> 00:50:15.059
Don't.

00:50:15.059 --> 00:50:18.059
Don't.

00:50:18.059 --> 00:50:21.059
Don't.

00:50:26.059 --> 00:50:28.059
Don't.

00:50:34.059 --> 00:50:37.059
Alice, click.

00:50:41.059 --> 00:50:43.059
What's your business?

00:50:43.059 --> 00:50:45.059
What's your business?

00:50:45.059 --> 00:50:48.059
What's your business?

00:50:48.059 --> 00:50:53.059
You've been sadness, I sense in your daughter.

00:50:54.059 --> 00:50:59.059
And my heart I know you still cared.

00:51:04.059 --> 00:51:08.059
But what never knows for sure.

00:51:17.059 --> 00:51:21.059
The reality is often disappointing.

00:51:23.059 --> 00:51:26.059
That is, it was.

00:51:27.059 --> 00:51:30.059
Now.

00:51:30.059 --> 00:51:35.059
Reality can be whatever I want.

00:51:35.059 --> 00:51:37.059
You knew I'd come.

00:51:37.059 --> 00:51:39.059
I killed Luna.

00:51:39.059 --> 00:51:43.059
There's something we need to discuss, little one.

00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:49.059
No!

00:51:54.059 --> 00:51:56.059
No!

00:51:56.059 --> 00:51:59.059
No!

00:51:59.059 --> 00:52:01.059
No!

00:52:01.059 --> 00:52:04.059
Let her go, Grimis.

00:52:04.059 --> 00:52:06.059
Peter.

00:52:06.059 --> 00:52:08.059
I told you to go right.

00:52:08.059 --> 00:52:10.059
Now.

00:52:10.059 --> 00:52:12.059
You let her go!

00:52:12.059 --> 00:52:14.059
Ah, the boyfriend.

00:52:14.059 --> 00:52:18.059
I like to think of myself more as a titan killing long term booty call.

00:52:18.059 --> 00:52:20.059
Let her go.

00:52:20.059 --> 00:52:25.059
I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face.

00:52:25.059 --> 00:52:28.059
Not him.

00:52:37.059 --> 00:52:39.059
You promised.

00:52:39.059 --> 00:52:42.059
You promised.

00:52:45.059 --> 00:52:47.059
No daughter.

00:52:47.059 --> 00:52:50.059
You expect too much for me?

00:52:53.059 --> 00:52:56.059
She's asked, has it she?

00:52:58.059 --> 00:53:01.059
Do it.

00:53:03.059 --> 00:53:06.059
You.

00:53:06.059 --> 00:53:08.059
Don't!

00:53:09.059 --> 00:53:11.059
Ah.

00:53:14.059 --> 00:53:17.059
I told you to go right.

00:53:17.059 --> 00:53:21.059
I love you more than anything.

00:53:23.059 --> 00:53:26.059
I love you too.

00:53:39.059 --> 00:53:41.059
I like you.

00:53:41.059 --> 00:53:43.059
Wait a minute.

00:54:09.059 --> 00:54:13.059
Still no work from Vision?

00:54:13.059 --> 00:54:16.059
Sad lights lost somewhere over Edinburgh.

00:54:16.059 --> 00:54:20.059
You know, in a stolen clinch at with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

00:54:20.059 --> 00:54:23.059
You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right?

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.059
Thank God, bro.

00:54:24.059 --> 00:54:28.059
It's your talent for horse shit, rivals, mind.

00:54:28.059 --> 00:54:31.059
If it weren't for those accords, Vision would have been right here.

00:54:31.059 --> 00:54:35.059
I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

00:54:35.059 --> 00:54:37.059
That's right.

00:54:38.059 --> 00:54:40.059
I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:41.059
You have second thoughts?

00:54:41.059 --> 00:54:44.059
Not anymore.

00:54:48.059 --> 00:54:51.059
Mr. Secretary?

00:54:55.059 --> 00:54:57.059
You got some nerve of...

00:54:57.059 --> 00:54:59.059
How could you be that?

00:54:59.059 --> 00:55:02.059
You could use some of that right now.

00:55:02.059 --> 00:55:05.059
The world's on fire.

00:55:05.059 --> 00:55:07.059
And you think...

00:55:07.059 --> 00:55:09.059
All is forgiven?

00:55:09.059 --> 00:55:11.059
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

00:55:11.059 --> 00:55:14.059
And I'm way past asking permission.

00:55:14.059 --> 00:55:17.059
Birth just lost your best defender.

00:55:17.059 --> 00:55:20.059
So we're here to fight.

00:55:20.059 --> 00:55:23.059
And if you want to stand in our way,

00:55:23.059 --> 00:55:26.059
we'll fight you too.

00:55:28.059 --> 00:55:30.059
I'll rest them.

00:55:30.059 --> 00:55:32.059
I'll over it.

00:55:36.059 --> 00:55:39.059
That's the court motion.

00:55:40.059 --> 00:55:43.059
It's great to see you, Colonel.

00:55:43.059 --> 00:55:45.059
You too, right?

00:55:47.059 --> 00:55:52.059
Well, you guys really look like crap.

00:55:52.059 --> 00:55:54.059
Must have been a rough couple of years.

00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:57.059
Yeah, well, the hotel's one exactly five-star.

00:55:57.059 --> 00:56:00.059
I think you look great.

00:56:05.059 --> 00:56:08.059
Yeah, I'm back.

00:56:10.059 --> 00:56:13.059
Hi, Bruce.

00:56:16.059 --> 00:56:19.059
Matt.

00:56:21.059 --> 00:56:24.059
This is awkward.

00:56:24.059 --> 00:56:27.059
So we got us soon. They're coming back, right?

00:56:27.059 --> 00:56:29.059
And they can clearly find us.

00:56:29.059 --> 00:56:31.059
We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

00:56:31.059 --> 00:56:33.059
After the whole court situation,

00:56:33.059 --> 00:56:36.059
we have Diel, who's too tough on their families on House arrest.

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.059
Who's Scott?

00:56:37.059 --> 00:56:38.059
Yeah, man.

00:56:38.059 --> 00:56:40.059
There's an and-and-a spider, Matt.

00:56:40.059 --> 00:56:44.059
Look, Thanos has the biggest army in the universe.

00:56:44.059 --> 00:56:48.059
And he is not going to stop until he gets...

00:56:48.059 --> 00:56:50.059
Visions stone.

00:56:50.059 --> 00:56:52.059
Well, then we have to protect it.

00:56:52.059 --> 00:56:55.059
No, we have to destroy it.

00:56:55.059 --> 00:57:00.059
I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head about its nature.

00:57:00.059 --> 00:57:02.059
Also, it's composition.

00:57:02.059 --> 00:57:06.059
I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source,

00:57:06.059 --> 00:57:11.059
something very similar to its own signature perhaps.

00:57:11.059 --> 00:57:14.059
It's molecular integrity, good faith.

00:57:14.059 --> 00:57:17.059
And you, with it,

00:57:17.059 --> 00:57:19.059
we're not having this conversation.

00:57:19.059 --> 00:57:23.059
Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

00:57:23.059 --> 00:57:26.059
That's too high a price.

00:57:30.059 --> 00:57:33.059
Only you have the power to pay it.

00:57:36.059 --> 00:57:39.059
Thanos threatens off the universe.

00:57:39.059 --> 00:57:41.059
One life cannot stand in the way of feeding him.

00:57:41.059 --> 00:57:43.059
But it should.

00:57:45.059 --> 00:57:46.059
We don't trade lives.

00:57:46.059 --> 00:57:48.059
We kept in 70 years ago,

00:57:48.059 --> 00:57:51.059
you'd lay down your life to save how many millions of people.

00:57:51.059 --> 00:57:53.059
Tell me, why is this any different?

00:57:53.059 --> 00:57:56.059
Because you might have a choice.

00:57:57.059 --> 00:58:01.059
Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays,

00:58:01.059 --> 00:58:05.059
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

00:58:05.059 --> 00:58:07.059
All of them mixed together.

00:58:07.059 --> 00:58:09.059
All of them learning from one another.

00:58:09.059 --> 00:58:11.059
You're saying vision isn't just the stone?

00:58:11.059 --> 00:58:14.059
I'm saying that if we take out the stone,

00:58:14.059 --> 00:58:17.059
there's still a whole lot of vision left, perhaps the best parts.

00:58:17.059 --> 00:58:19.059
Can we do that?

00:58:19.059 --> 00:58:21.059
Not me, not here.

00:58:21.059 --> 00:58:24.059
Well, you better find someone and somewhere fast.

00:58:24.059 --> 00:58:29.059
Ross isn't just going to let you guys have your old moons back.

00:58:29.059 --> 00:58:31.059
I know somewhere.

00:58:46.059 --> 00:58:49.059
The King's God and the Dora Malash have been alletted.

00:58:49.059 --> 00:58:50.059
The bother tribe?

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:52.059
Those that are left.

00:58:52.059 --> 00:58:55.059
Send the white to the tribe already as well.

00:58:55.059 --> 00:58:57.059
Raku likes the old sides.

00:58:57.059 --> 00:58:59.059
Here we come, Kat.

00:58:59.059 --> 00:59:01.059
Then what of this one?

00:59:01.059 --> 00:59:04.059
This one may be tired of war,

00:59:04.059 --> 00:59:07.059
but the white wolf has rested long enough.

00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:25.059
Where is the fight?

00:59:25.059 --> 00:59:28.059
On its way.

00:59:52.059 --> 00:59:55.059
In all the time I've served Thanos,

00:59:55.059 --> 00:59:58.059
I have never failed him.

01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:06.059
If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan,

01:00:06.059 --> 01:00:10.059
with the timestamps ill-attached or vaguely irritating person,

01:00:10.059 --> 01:00:13.059
there would be judgment.

01:00:22.059 --> 01:00:24.059
Give me.

01:00:27.059 --> 01:00:29.059
What the stuff?

01:00:41.059 --> 01:00:44.059
Wow, you were seriously loyal piece of outta where is your...

01:00:44.059 --> 01:00:46.059
Yeah, I was speaking of loyalty.

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:47.059
What?

01:00:47.059 --> 01:00:48.059
What's up?

01:00:48.059 --> 01:00:49.059
I know what you're gonna say.

01:00:49.059 --> 01:00:50.059
You should not be here.

01:00:50.059 --> 01:00:51.059
I was gonna go home.

01:00:51.059 --> 01:00:53.059
I just thought about you and now I gotta hear.

01:00:53.059 --> 01:00:55.059
The stuff to the side of the ship and this suit is...

01:00:55.059 --> 01:00:57.059
...particularly intuitive, by the way.

01:00:57.059 --> 01:01:00.059
So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

01:01:00.059 --> 01:01:01.059
What did you just say?

01:01:01.059 --> 01:01:02.059
I take that back.

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:04.059
And now I'm here in space.

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:06.059
Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

01:01:06.059 --> 01:01:08.059
It's as if calling me a highland and something future.

01:01:08.059 --> 01:01:09.059
This is all a way ticket.

01:01:09.059 --> 01:01:10.059
You hear me?

01:01:10.059 --> 01:01:11.059
Don't pretend you felt this thing.

01:01:11.059 --> 01:01:12.059
I know you did.

01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:13.059
You could not know.

01:01:13.059 --> 01:01:17.059
You can't be a friendly neighborhood spider-man if there's no neighborhood.

01:01:18.059 --> 01:01:21.059
Okay, that didn't really make sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:26.059
Come on, we're gonna situation.

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:28.059
I'll see you down there.

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:29.059
You can trouble with your plan.

01:01:29.059 --> 01:01:30.059
Go.

01:01:31.059 --> 01:01:32.059
Okay, okay.

01:01:33.059 --> 01:01:36.059
Okay, do you ever see this really old movie aliens?

01:01:41.059 --> 01:01:42.059
I'm there.

01:01:43.059 --> 01:01:45.059
They were originally designed for microsurgeon.

01:01:47.059 --> 01:01:48.059
And any one of them.

01:01:54.059 --> 01:01:56.059
Good and your friend's life in an instant.

01:01:56.059 --> 01:01:58.059
I gotta tell you he's not really my friend.

01:01:58.059 --> 01:02:01.059
Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.

01:02:03.059 --> 01:02:04.059
You've saved nothing.

01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:09.059
Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.059
Yeah, but the kids seem more moviesome.

01:02:18.059 --> 01:02:19.059
Yeah.

01:02:27.059 --> 01:02:28.059
Wait, what are those?

01:02:29.059 --> 01:02:30.059
Ah!

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:45.059
Okay, we have an efficiently led.

01:02:46.059 --> 01:02:47.059
Cool.

01:02:49.059 --> 01:02:51.059
Gotta turn the ship around.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.059
Yeah.

01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:53.059
Now he wants to run.

01:02:53.059 --> 01:02:54.059
Great.

01:02:54.059 --> 01:02:55.059
I want to protect the stone.

01:02:55.059 --> 01:02:56.059
And I want you to thank me now.

01:02:56.059 --> 01:02:57.059
Go ahead. I'm listening.

01:02:57.059 --> 01:02:58.059
For what?

01:02:58.059 --> 01:03:00.059
You're really blasting me in this space?

01:03:00.059 --> 01:03:02.059
Who just saved your bench glass?

01:03:02.059 --> 01:03:03.059
Me.

01:03:03.059 --> 01:03:05.059
I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.

01:03:05.059 --> 01:03:07.059
Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to.

01:03:07.059 --> 01:03:09.059
I tried to bench you. You refused.

01:03:09.059 --> 01:03:11.059
Unlike everyone else in your life. I don't work for you.

01:03:11.059 --> 01:03:14.059
And due to that fact, we're now in a flying donut.

01:03:14.059 --> 01:03:16.059
Billions of miles from Earth with no backup.

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:17.059
I'm back up?

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:18.059
No. You're still away.

01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:19.059
The adults are talking.

01:03:19.059 --> 01:03:22.059
I'm sorry. I'm confused as to the relationship here.

01:03:22.059 --> 01:03:24.059
What is your ward?

01:03:24.059 --> 01:03:25.059
No.

01:03:25.059 --> 01:03:26.059
I'm Peter by the way.

01:03:27.059 --> 01:03:28.059
Dr. Strange.

01:03:28.059 --> 01:03:29.059
Oh, you're using the made-up names.

01:03:29.059 --> 01:03:32.059
I'm... I'm Spider-Man then.

01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:34.059
This ship is self-correcting its course.

01:03:34.059 --> 01:03:35.059
Things are not a pilot.

01:03:35.059 --> 01:03:37.059
Can we control it?

01:03:37.059 --> 01:03:39.059
Fly us home?

01:03:42.059 --> 01:03:43.059
Stark.

01:03:43.059 --> 01:03:44.059
Yeah.

01:03:44.059 --> 01:03:45.059
Can you get us home?

01:03:45.059 --> 01:03:47.059
Yeah, I heard you.

01:03:47.059 --> 01:03:50.059
I think I'm not so sure we should.

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:54.059
Under no circumstances can we bring the time stone to Thanos.

01:03:54.059 --> 01:03:56.059
I don't think you quite understand what's its snow.

01:03:56.059 --> 01:04:05.059
It's you who doesn't understand that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back.

01:04:05.059 --> 01:04:07.059
And I don't know what to do.

01:04:07.059 --> 01:04:14.059
So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan if I'd want to alter it for his, but you saw what they did, what they can do.

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:17.059
The reason is, Trophy's not expecting it.

01:04:17.059 --> 01:04:20.059
So I say we take the fight to him.

01:04:20.059 --> 01:04:21.059
Doctor.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.059
Do you concur?

01:04:27.059 --> 01:04:28.059
Alright, Stark.

01:04:28.059 --> 01:04:30.059
We go to him.

01:04:30.059 --> 01:04:40.059
But you have to understand, if it comes to saving you or the kid or the time stone, I will not hesitate to let either of you die.

01:04:40.059 --> 01:04:45.059
I can't, because the universe depends on it.

01:04:45.059 --> 01:04:46.059
Nice.

01:04:46.059 --> 01:04:48.059
Good. More comes.

01:04:49.059 --> 01:04:50.059
Restream.

01:04:52.059 --> 01:04:53.059
Our kid.

01:04:53.059 --> 01:04:56.059
You're an eventually no.

01:05:24.059 --> 01:05:26.059
I thought you might be hungry.

01:05:47.059 --> 01:05:49.059
I always hated that chair.

01:05:49.059 --> 01:05:55.059
So I've been told, even so, I helped you set a new one day.

01:05:56.059 --> 01:05:58.059
I hated that room.

01:05:58.059 --> 01:06:00.059
A shop.

01:06:00.059 --> 01:06:02.059
I hated my life.

01:06:06.059 --> 01:06:08.059
You told me that too.

01:06:11.059 --> 01:06:13.059
Every day.

01:06:14.059 --> 01:06:17.059
For almost 20 years.

01:06:19.059 --> 01:06:22.059
Who's a child when you took me?

01:06:23.059 --> 01:06:25.059
I saved you.

01:06:28.059 --> 01:06:30.059
No.

01:06:30.059 --> 01:06:32.059
No.

01:06:32.059 --> 01:06:34.059
We were happy on my own planet.

01:06:34.059 --> 01:06:36.059
You're in the bed hungry.

01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:38.059
Scroozing for scraps.

01:06:38.059 --> 01:06:41.059
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.

01:06:41.059 --> 01:06:44.059
I'm the one who stopped that.

01:06:44.059 --> 01:06:46.059
You know what's happened since then?

01:06:46.059 --> 01:06:48.059
The children born.

01:06:48.059 --> 01:06:55.059
Have known nothing, but full bellies and clear skies, it's a paradise.

01:06:55.059 --> 01:06:58.059
Because you murdered half the planet.

01:06:58.059 --> 01:07:01.059
A small prize to pay for salvation.

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:02.059
You're insane.

01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:04.059
Little one, it's a simple calculus.

01:07:04.059 --> 01:07:06.059
This universe is finite.

01:07:06.059 --> 01:07:08.059
It's resources finite.

01:07:08.059 --> 01:07:10.059
You've done checked life.

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:12.059
Who ceased to exist?

01:07:12.059 --> 01:07:13.059
It needs correctness.

01:07:13.059 --> 01:07:15.059
You don't know that.

01:07:15.059 --> 01:07:19.059
I'm the only one who knows that.

01:07:19.059 --> 01:07:24.059
At least I'm the only one with the will to act on it.

01:07:24.059 --> 01:07:27.059
For a time.

01:07:27.059 --> 01:07:30.059
You.

01:07:30.059 --> 01:07:34.059
Had that same will.

01:07:34.059 --> 01:07:37.059
As you fought by my side.

01:07:37.059 --> 01:07:39.059
Daughter.

01:07:39.059 --> 01:07:43.059
I'm not your daughter.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:46.059
Everything I heard about myself, he told me.

01:07:46.059 --> 01:07:53.059
Then in doing so, major the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

01:07:53.059 --> 01:07:59.059
That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

01:07:59.059 --> 01:08:03.059
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

01:08:03.059 --> 01:08:06.059
I am disappointed.

01:08:06.059 --> 01:08:12.059
And that because you didn't find it.

01:08:12.059 --> 01:08:15.059
But because you did.

01:08:15.059 --> 01:08:18.059
And you lied.

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.060
Don't do this.

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:27.060
Sometime ago your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:30.060
I'm sorry.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.060
I'm sorry.

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.060
I'm sorry.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:39.060
I'm sorry.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:42.060
I'm sorry.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.060
Don't do this.

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.060
No, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.060
Please don't do this.

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:53.060
She very nearly succeeded.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:56.060
So I brought her here.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.060
To talk.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.060
No!

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:05.060
No!

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:08.060
Stop it.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:15.060
I swear to you on my life.

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:21.060
I never found the Soul Stone.

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.060
Accessing memory files.

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:25.060
You know what he's about to do.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.060
He's finally ready.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.060
And he's going for the stones.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.060
All of them never get them all.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.060
He's with.

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.060
He can't, Nebula.

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.060
Because I found the map to the Soul Stone.

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.060
And I burnt it to ash.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:42.060
I burnt it.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:46.060
You're strong.

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:50.060
Me.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:53.060
The generous.

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.060
Me.

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.060
But I never taught you to lie.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:03.060
That's why you're so bad at it.

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:09.060
Where is the Soul Stone?

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:12.060
Ah!

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.060
Ah!

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.060
Ah!

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:21.060
Ah!

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:24.060
Ah!

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.060
Ah!

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:29.060
Barmier!

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:40.060
This stone is on Barmier.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:43.060
Show me.

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:45.060
I am grotesque.

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:47.060
Take a look at the cup.

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.060
We're not looking.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.060
We'll see it as seen.

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.060
What's it to wait?

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:53.060
Everybody see it?

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.060
I'm grotesque.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.060
Take a look at the cup.

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.060
We're not looking.

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.060
We'll see it as seen.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.060
What's it to wait?

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.060
Everybody see it?

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.060
I'm grotesque.

01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:02.060
I'm a tree forward.

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.060
It's in the cup out in the space.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.060
You can go on the cup again.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:05.060
You speak grotesque.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:07.060
Yes, the door is on Asgard.

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.060
It was an elective.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.060
I am grotesque.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.060
You'll know what we're close.

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:18.060
If it lives forge, harnesses the blazing power of a neutron star.

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.060
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:23.060
It's truly awesome.

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.060
Okay.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.060
Time to be the captain.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.060
So, dead brother, huh?

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.060
Yeah, I could be annoying.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:41.060
Well, he's been dead before.

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:45.060
You know, this time I think it really might be true.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.060
And you said you're sister and your dad.

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.060
Both dead.

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:51.060
But still got a mom, though?

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.060
Killed by a darker.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.060
Killed by a darker.

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:56.060
A best friend?

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.060
Stubbed through the heart.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.060
You sure you're up to this particular motor mission?

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.060
Absolutely.

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:12.060
A rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret,

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.060
the ultimate is motive.

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.060
They really clear the mind.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.060
So, I'm good to go.

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:20.060
Yeah, but I mean, the stannos we're talking about.

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.060
He's the toughest there is.

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:23.060
Well, he's never fought me.

01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.060
Yeah, he has.

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.060
He's never fought me twice.

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.060
And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.060
Well, I better be some hammer.

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:37.060
You know, I'm 1500 years old.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.060
I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:42.060
And every one of them would have rather killed me,

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:43.060
but none succeeded.

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:46.060
I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:50.060
The Thanos is just the latest and long line of bastards

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:52.060
and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance, fate.

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:53.060
Will's it so?

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.060
Mm-hmm.

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:57.060
And what if you're wrong?

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:03.060
Well, if I'm wrong, then...

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.060
What more could I lose?

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:07.060
I can't lose him.

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:13.060
I can't lose him.

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.060
I can't lose him.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.060
I can't lose him.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.060
I can't lose him.

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.060
I can't lose him.

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:28.060
Okay.

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.060
Well, if fate does want you to kill that crap sack,

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:34.060
you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.060
What's this?

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:37.060
What's it look like?

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:39.060
Some jerk lost a bet with me in contracts here.

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.060
They gave you a zah.

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.060
Nah, he gave me a hundred credits.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:45.060
I schnucked him in his room later that night, stole his eye.

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:49.060
Thank you, sweet Robert.

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:56.060
Oh.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.060
I would have watched that.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:02.060
The only way I could sneak it off contracts here was a lie.

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.060
Hey, we're here.

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:11.060
I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.060
I hate the eye.

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.060
Something's wrong.

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:32.060
The stars got out.

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:35.060
And the rings of Frozen are.

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.060
I hope these two are of the better and fortune than they are cleaning.

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:05.060
Maybe they realized that they live in a junk pile in a middle of space.

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:08.060
This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:15.060
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:16.060
Yes, what?

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:19.060
You look anything like that?

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.060
I am broke.

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.060
Good back to the pod.

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:32.060
The tree waits.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.060
Stop.

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.060
So?

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:42.060
What happened here?

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:45.060
You were supposed to protect us.

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.060
I thought was supposed to protect us.

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:51.060
As God is destroyed.

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.060
The tree.

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:57.060
I love what did you do?

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:03.060
Huh?

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:12.060
Three hundred walls have done this ring.

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:17.060
I thought you'd find out what he asked. They'd be safe.

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:21.060
I made what he wanted.

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:27.060
A device capable of harnessing the power of the stars.

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:33.060
And then he killed everyone anyway.

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.060
Who accepted me?

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:41.060
Your life is yours, he said.

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:43.060
But your hands.

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:46.060
Your hands are mine alone.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.060
You treat this as an abound your hands.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:55.060
Every weapon you've ever designed every axe hammer sawed at all inside your head.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:58.060
Now I know it feels like all hope has lost trust me.

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.060
I know.

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:05.060
But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.060
Um?

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.060
Mountess?

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.060
Listen very carefully.

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:51.060
I need you to meet me on Titan.

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.060
Okay, what's going on?

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.060
I think we're here.

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:03.060
I don't think this rig has a self-park function.

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:06.060
Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:08.060
Close those around it.

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.060
Understand?

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.060
Yes, we've got it.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.060
We've got to move it at the same time.

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.060
Okay, ready?

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:17.060
I might not want to turn.

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:20.060
Turn, turn, turn!

01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.060
All right?

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:30.060
That was close.

01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:35.060
Oh, you want it?

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:38.060
I don't want to turn.

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.060
I want to turn.

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:43.060
I want to turn.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:46.060
I want to turn.

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.060
I want to turn.

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:51.060
All right?

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.060
That was close.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.060
Oh, you want it?

01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:00.060
Let me just say, if aliens wind up in planning eggs in my chest or something,

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.060
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:04.060
I do not want another single pot culture reference.

01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:06.060
I do you forgresting the trick, you understand?

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:09.060
I'm trying to say that something is coming.

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:17.060
Thanos!

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:20.060
No!

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:28.060
Oh, no!

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:31.060
Oh, no!

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:34.060
Oh, no!

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.060
Oh, no!

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:38.060
Oh, no!

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.060
Oh, no!

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:41.060
Please don't put your eggs in me!

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:43.060
No!

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:45.060
Stay down!

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:47.060
Oh, no!

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.060
Die!

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:49.060
Flake it up!

01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.060
Yes!

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:58.060
Everybody stay where you are till the end bout!

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:01.060
I'm going to ask you this one time.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.060
Where is Gamora?

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:05.060
Yeah, I'll do you one better.

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.060
Who's Gamora?

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:08.060
I'll do you one better.

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.060
Why is Gamora?

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:12.060
Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you, I'm going to French fry this little freak.

01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.060
Let's do it.

01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.060
You shoot my guy and I'll blast him.

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.060
Let's go!

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:18.060
Do it, Quill.

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.060
I can take it.

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.060
No, he can't take it.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.060
You can't.

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:23.060
Oh yeah, you don't want to tell me where she is?

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.060
That's fine.

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.060
I'll kill all three of you and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.060
Starting with you.

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.060
Wait, what?

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.060
Down.

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:31.060
Alright, let me ask you this one time.

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:33.060
What master do you serve?

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.060
What master do I serve?

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:37.060
What am I supposed to say, Jesus?

01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:38.060
You're from Earth.

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.060
Not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:40.060
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:41.060
What do you have so long as for?

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:44.060
So you're not with Thanos?

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.060
With Thanos?

01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:47.060
No.

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:49.060
I'm here to kill Thanos.

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:50.060
He took my girl away.

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.060
Who are you?

01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:53.060
Where are the Avengers, man?

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.060
You're the ones Thor told us about.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.060
You know Thor.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.060
Yeah.

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:01.060
Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:03.060
Where is he now?

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:13.060
This is the plan we're going to hit him with a brick.

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:21.060
It's a mold.

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:26.060
A king's weapon meant to be the greatest in ours, God.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:29.060
In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:32.060
That have a name.

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.060
Stormbreaker.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:36.060
Yeah, it's a bit much.

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:39.060
So how do we make it?

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:42.060
You left a restart, the forge.

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:48.060
To awaken the heart of a dying star.

01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:54.060
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.060
The hell happened to this planet?

01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:58.060
It's eight degrees off its axis.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:01.060
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.060
Yeah, we got one advantage.

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.060
He's coming to us.

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.060
We'll use it.

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.060
All right, I have a plan.

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:10.060
We're at least the beginnings of one.

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.060
It's pretty simple.

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:13.060
We draw them in, pin them down, get what we need.

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:14.060
Definitely don't want to dance with this guy.

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:16.060
We just want the gauntlet.

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:18.060
Are you yawning?

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:19.060
In the middle of this?

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.060
Well, I'm breaking it down.

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:21.060
Huh?

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.060
Did you hear what I said?

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:25.060
Stop listening after you said we need a plan.

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.060
Okay, Mr. Kling is on his own page.

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:29.060
See, not winging it isn't really what they do.

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:31.060
What exactly is it that they do?

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:33.060
Kick names, take us.

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.060
Yeah, that's fine.

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:42.060
All right, just get over here, please.

01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:45.060
Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle out?

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.060
Mr. Lord.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.060
Star Lord is fine.

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:50.060
We've got to call us.

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:53.060
Because if all we come out of him with is a plucky attitude.

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:55.060
Dude, don't call us plucky.

01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:57.060
We don't know what it means.

01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:59.060
All right, we're optimistic, yes.

01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:01.060
I like your plan, except it sucks.

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:04.060
So let me do the plan and that way, it might be really good.

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.060
Tell him about the dance off to save the universe.

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.060
But dance off.

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:09.060
It's not a, it's not a, it's not a...

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:10.060
I can fo-oost a movie.

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.060
Exactly like fo-oost.

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.060
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.060
It never was.

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.060
Don't encourage this, all right?

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.060
We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.060
Flash Gordon?

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.060
By the way, that's a compliment.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:22.060
Don't forget.

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:24.060
I'm half human, so that 50% of me, that's stupid.

01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:26.060
That's 100% you.

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.060
Your math is blowing my mind.

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:29.060
Excuse me?

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:33.060
But does your friend often do that?

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.060
Strange.

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.060
Are we all right?

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:48.060
Be back, you're...

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:50.060
Hey, what was that?

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.060
Looking forward in time.

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:55.060
To view alternate futures.

01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:58.060
To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.

01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:01.060
How many did you see?

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.060
14,605.

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.060
How many were we in?

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.060
One.

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:24.060
The stone had better be up there.

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:30.060
For a sister's sake.

01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:54.060
The stone.

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.060
Welcome, Athenos.

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.060
Son of Elis.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.060
Camara.

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.060
Doctor Athenos.

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:13.060
You know us.

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:18.060
It is my cursed, not all, who Johnny is.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.060
Where is the Soul Stone?

01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:23.060
You should know.

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:26.060
He extracts a terrible price.

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:29.060
I'm prepared.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:34.060
We all think that at first.

01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:41.060
We are all wrong.

01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:54.060
How is it you know this place so well?

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:56.060
A lifetime ago.

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:59.060
I too sought the stones.

01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:02.060
I even healed one in my hand.

01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:04.060
But it cursed me out.

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:06.060
Banished me here.

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:10.060
Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.

01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:15.060
What you seek lies in front of you.

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.060
As does what you fear.

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:19.060
What's this?

01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:20.060
The price.

01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:26.060
The Soul holds a special place among the infinity stones.

01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:30.060
You might say it is a certain wisdom.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:33.060
But it is a very important thing.

01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:36.060
Tell me what it means.

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:41.060
To ensure that whoever possesses it understands its power.

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:45.060
The stone demands a sacrifice.

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.060
Of what?

01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:52.060
In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love.

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:07.060
Soul... for a soul.

01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:26.060
All my life, I dreamed of a day.

01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:28.060
A moment...

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:32.060
When you got what you deserved.

01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:36.060
And I was always so disappointed.

01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:41.060
But now...

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:46.060
You kill...

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.060
And torture.

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:52.060
And you call it mercy.

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:58.060
The universe has judged you.

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:01.060
You asked it for a prize.

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:04.060
And I told you no one.

01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:07.060
You failed.

01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.060
And do you want to know why?

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:13.060
Because you love nothing.

01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:15.060
No one.

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.060
Really?

01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.060
Tears?

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.060
They're not for him.

01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:48.060
No.

01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.060
This isn't love.

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:55.060
I ignored my destiny once.

01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:59.060
I cannot do that again.

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:02.060
Even for you.

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:05.060
I'm sorry, little one.

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:35.060
I'm sorry.

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:05.060
I'm sorry.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:35.060
I'm sorry.

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.060
I'm sorry.

01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:14.060
Chapter 2600 heading 030.

01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.060
I hope you're right about this.

01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:19.060
We're going to land a lot faster than you want to.

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:37.060
When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world,

01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:40.060
this is not what I imagined.

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:42.060
And what did you imagine?

01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:44.060
The Olympics.

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.060
Even at Star Wars.

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:01.060
Should we bow?

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:03.060
There he is.

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:06.060
Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.

01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:08.060
What are you doing?

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:11.060
We don't do that here.

01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:13.060
So how big of an assault should we expect?

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:16.060
Sir, I think you should expect quite a big assault.

01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:17.060
How are we looking?

01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:21.060
You will have my King's Gotam, the border driver, the Dora Manage.

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:23.060
And...

01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:26.060
Let's send my stable 100-year-old man.

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:29.060
How you doing, Buck?

01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:32.060
Not bad for the other world.

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:46.060
Oh.

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.060
The structure is polymorphic.

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:52.060
Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequential.

01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:55.060
Why didn't you just reprogram this synapsis to work collectively?

01:32:56.060 --> 01:33:00.060
Because we didn't think of it?

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.060
I'm sure you did your best.

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:04.060
Can you do it?

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:07.060
Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here.

01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:11.060
One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:14.060
So take time, brother.

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:16.060
How long?

01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:19.060
As long as you can give me.

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:24.060
Something's entered the atmosphere.

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.060
What's going on?

01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:30.060
I'm not sure.

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:33.060
I'm not sure.

01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:35.060
I'm not sure.

01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:37.060
I'm not sure.

01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:40.060
I'm not sure.

01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:43.060
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:54.060
God, I love this place.

01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:56.060
Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:58.060
We got more incoming outside the dome.

01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:19.060
It's too late.

01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:21.060
We need to destroy the stone.

01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:23.060
They should get your house back on the table.

01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:25.060
We will hold them off.

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:28.060
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out of this magnitude,

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:30.060
you blow it to hell.

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:34.060
I will evacuate the city and gauge all defenses.

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:37.060
Get this man a sheet.

01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:48.060
I don't think you get the scientific here.

01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:50.060
These rings are gigantic.

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:52.060
You want to get them moving.

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:54.060
They're a little bigger than the egg of wolves.

01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:55.060
Leave it to me.

01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:56.060
Leave it to you.

01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:58.060
Buddy, you're in space.

01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:00.060
All you got is a wrong thing.

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:10.060
I have the entrance.

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:25.060
More power, Robert.

01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:55.060
We'll get more.

01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:58.060
That's little rare.

01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.060
Damn it.

01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:27.060
Damn it.

01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:29.060
What's the mechanism?

01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:30.060
What?

01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:32.060
With the iris closed, I can't heat the metal.

01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:34.060
How long will it take to heat it?

01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:37.060
A few minutes. Maybe more or why?

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:40.060
I'm going to hold it open.

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.060
That suicide.

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:44.060
It was facing Thanos without that axe.

01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:55.060
How are you looking, Bruce?

01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:57.060
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:59.060
What a hell!

01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:02.060
It was so amazing, man.

01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:03.060
It's like being a wolf.

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.060
That axe...

01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:09.060
That was big.

01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.060
It's okay.

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:14.060
I've got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.

01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:24.060
The fire!

01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:29.060
At least I have one.

01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:35.060
Beta!

01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:37.060
Beta!

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:39.060
Beta!

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:40.060
Beta!

01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:45.060
Thank you for standing with us.

01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:46.060
I'm for it, too.

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.060
Where's your other friend?

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.060
He will pay for his life with yours.

01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:58.060
Thanos will have that stone.

01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:00.060
It's not gonna happen.

01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:02.060
You, I and Wakanda now.

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:06.060
Thanos would have nothing but dust.

01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:08.060
I'm not sure if he's gonna have a sword.

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:10.060
It's not gonna happen.

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.060
He's a dead man.

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:14.060
I don't know.

01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:16.060
I'm sure he's not.

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.060
I don't know.

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:20.060
He's a dead man.

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:24.060
He'll have nothing but dust and blood.

01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:28.060
We have blood to spare.

01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:42.060
Is this surrender?

01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:44.060
Exactly.

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:52.060
He's a dead man.

01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:54.060
He's a dead man.

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:56.060
He's a dead man.

01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.060
He's a dead man.

01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:00.060
He's a dead man.

01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:02.060
He's a dead man.

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:12.060
What the hell?

01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:16.060
Looks like we've hissed her off.

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:22.060
They're killing themselves.

01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:24.060
They're killing themselves.

01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:48.060
Who's that?

01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:54.060
Who's that?

01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:06.060
You see the teeth on our things?

01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.060
Back up, Sammy. I get you wings.

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:10.060
I'll take you to the next one.

01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:22.060
Can't put these things sort of in the perimeter

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:24.060
and get in behind us. There's nothing between them in vision.

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.060
We better keep them in front of us.

01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:28.060
How do we do that?

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.060
We open the barrier.

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:38.060
On my signal, open northwest section 7 and 10.

01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:40.060
Requesting confirmation, my king.

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:42.060
You said open the barrier?

01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:44.060
On my signal.

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:46.060
This will be the end of our conduct.

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:50.060
They need to be the nobest ending in the history.

01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:54.060
Bula!

01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:04.060
Bukanda, move on!

01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:06.060
Bukanda, move on!

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:20.060
Go!

01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:34.060
Go!

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:52.060
How much do you want?

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:54.060
A belly-peeked brother.

01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:56.060
You might want to pick up the pest.

01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:04.060
You'll fall.

01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:06.060
You understand, boy.

01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.060
You're about to take the full force of a star.

01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:12.060
It'll kill you.

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.060
And if I die?

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:16.060
Yes.

01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.060
That's what killing you means.

01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:34.060
I'll kill you.

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.060
Hold it!

01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:50.060
Hold it!

01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:34.060
Do I say something?

01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:36.060
Do I yield me?

01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:50.060
I think he's done.

01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.060
He needs the axe.

01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:56.060
Where's the hot note?

01:43:56.060 --> 01:44:01.060
Three! Help me find the handle!

01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.060
Yes!

01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.060
It's too many of them!

01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:28.060
You guys are so good now!

01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:58.060
Oh yeah!

01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:20.060
Oh yeah!

01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:25.060
You're much more of a Thanos.

01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:29.060
I take it to Mars, Dad.

01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:34.060
Mr. Day extracts a heavy toll.

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:37.060
Still he accomplished his mission.

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:39.060
You may regret that.

01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:44.060
He brought you face to face with the master of the Mystic Arts.

01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:49.060
Where do you think he brought you?

01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:52.060
Let me guess.

01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:54.060
Your home?

01:46:58.060 --> 01:46:59.060
It was.

01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:04.060
And it was beautiful.

01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:08.060
Titan was like most planets.

01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:11.060
20 mounds not enough to go around.

01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:15.060
And when we faced extinction I offered a solution.

01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:17.060
Genocide.

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:23.060
But random, dispassionate, fair, and rich and poor alike.

01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:26.060
They called me a madman.

01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:29.060
And what I predict akin to Thanos.

01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:34.060
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:35.060
I'm a survivor.

01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:38.060
Who wants to murder trillions.

01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:42.060
The all six stones I could simply snap my fingers.

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:45.060
They would all cease to exist and I call that.

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:48.060
Mercy.

01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:51.060
And then what?

01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:54.060
I finally rest.

01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:58.060
And watch the sunrise on a grateful universe.

01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:02.060
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:08.060
I think you'll find our will equal to yours.

01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:10.060
Our...

01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:18.060
Piece of cake, Will.

01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:21.060
Yeah, if your goal was to piss them off.

01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:48.060
Oh.

01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:59.060
Boom.

01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:02.060
Don't run and close his fist.

01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:08.060
Magic.

01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:10.060
Or magic.

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:12.060
Magic with the kid.

01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:14.060
Magic with the...

01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:16.060
insect.

01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:47.060
Well, well.

01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:50.060
You should have killed me.

01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:52.060
Would have been a waste of parts.

01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:54.060
No.

01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:56.060
No.

01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:58.060
Where is Gamora?

01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:01.060
No.

01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:03.060
No.

01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:06.060
No.

01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:09.060
No.

01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:12.060
No.

01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:15.060
No.

01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:18.060
No.

01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:21.060
No.

01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:25.060
No.

01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:30.060
No.

01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:33.060
No.

01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:36.060
No.

01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:40.060
No.

01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:43.060
No.

01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:45.060
Is he utter?

01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:46.060
Don't let up.

01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:47.060
Be quick.

01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:49.060
He is very strong.

01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:50.060
Parker? Help!

01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:51.060
Get over here.

01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:52.060
She can't hold my shoulder.

01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:54.060
Let's go.

01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:01.060
I thought you'd be hard to catch for the record.

01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:03.060
This is my plan.

01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:06.060
Got so strong now, huh?

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:09.060
Where is Gamora?

01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:11.060
I'm here tomorrow.

01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:13.060
Shit.

01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:15.060
Where is she?

01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:17.060
He's in anguish.

01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:19.060
Good.

01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:22.060
He... he mourns.

01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:24.060
What is this monster?

01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:27.060
I have to mourn.

01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:30.060
Gamora.

01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:33.060
What?

01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:35.060
You took her to warn me.

01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:38.060
He came back with the sauce still.

01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:41.060
Okay, Clill.

01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:43.060
You got to call it right now.

01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:45.060
Do you understand?

01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:46.060
Don't, don't.

01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.060
Don't you case.

01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:49.060
We almost got this off!

01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:52.060
Tell me she's lying.

01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:54.060
Asshole!

01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:57.060
Tell me you didn't do it.

01:51:57.060 --> 01:52:01.060
I had to...

01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:03.060
...pray didn't.

01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:05.060
Oh, you didn't.

01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:09.060
How you did that?

01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:11.060
Stop!

01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:13.060
Stop!

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:15.060
Let's go.

01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:19.060
Oh, god.

01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:37.060
Shit.

01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:08.060
Shit.

01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:22.060
Come and get some, based on...

01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:27.060
Come on, get some, get some!

01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:30.060
Come on, get some!

01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:31.060
How much for the gun?

01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:32.060
Not for sale.

01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:34.060
Okay, how much for the arms?

01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:38.060
I'll get that on.

01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:48.060
You okay?

01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:51.060
Notice we've copied my beard.

01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:54.060
By the way, this is a friend of mine.

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:56.060
I'm free.

01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:00.060
I am Steve Rogers.

01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:08.060
I'm free.

01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:22.060
Go back! Go back now!

01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:33.060
Folks that fire on the left flank, Sam.

01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:35.060
I'm so with it!

01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:00.060
Why was she up there all this time?

01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:03.060
She's on the field. Take it.

01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:33.060
God, we got a vision situation here.

01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:42.060
Somebody get the vision!

01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.060
I got him!

01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:53.060
She'll die alone, as will you.

01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:55.060
She's not alone.

01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:02.060
I'm free.

01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:22.060
Oh, no. I know you don't.

01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:24.060
This is gonna be like New York Pal.

01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:27.060
This suit's already kicked the crap out of the hall.

01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:33.060
Guys, vision needs back on now.

01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:37.060
Oh, oh, oh.

01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:39.060
I know you're making your entrance in the last second.

01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:40.060
Oh, this is it, man.

01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:42.060
This is the last, last second.

01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:56.060
Oh, screw you, you big green asshole!

01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:58.060
I'll do it myself!

01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:00.060
Come on!

01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:21.060
Oh!

01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:24.060
Oh, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:41.060
I thought you were a formidable machine.

01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:44.060
But you're dying like any man.

01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:54.060
Get in here!

01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:59.060
Go!

01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:19.060
That was really gross.

01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:22.060
Oh, I can't.

01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:30.060
I can't.

01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:31.060
I can't.

01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:34.060
I can't.

01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:48.060
I thought I told you to go on.

01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:50.060
We don't afraid lies get it.

01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:55.060
I got you! I got you!

01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:59.060
Sorry, I can't remember anybody's names.

01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:25.060
I'm sorry, I can't remember anybody's names.

01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:54.060
Your full of tricks, Wizard.

01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:59.060
You never once choose your greatest weapon.

02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:04.060
A fake.

02:00:11.060 --> 02:00:13.060
You thrown a gun at me.

02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:15.060
And I'm gonna lose it.

02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:16.060
Stalk.

02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:17.060
You know me?

02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:19.060
I do.

02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:23.060
You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:25.060
My only curse is you.

02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:52.060
All that for a drop of blood.

02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:22.060
You have my respect, Stark.

02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:25.060
When I'm done half of humanity will steal the alive.

02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:27.060
I'm gonna lose it all.

02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:29.060
I'm gonna lose it all.

02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:31.060
I'm gonna lose it all.

02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:33.060
I'm gonna lose it all.

02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:44.060
You have my respect, Stark.

02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:47.060
But I'm done half of humanity will steal the alive.

02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:49.060
and he will still be alive.

02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:56.500
I hope they remember you.

02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.500
Stop!

02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:10.500
I hope you will remember you.

02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:18.500
Spare his life and I will give you this stone.

02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:24.500
No tricks.

02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:30.500
Don't!

02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:40.500
I hope you will remember you.

02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.500
I hope you will remember you.

02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:22.500
One to go.

02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:34.500
Where is he?

02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:40.500
Did we just lose?

02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:48.500
Why would you do that?

02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:54.500
We're in the end game now.

02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:10.500
We're in the end game.

02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:22.500
Are you okay?

02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:26.500
What is it?

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:30.500
He's here.

02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:40.500
Everyone on my position.

02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:44.500
We are incoming.

02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:48.500
What the...

02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:10.500
I'm sorry.

02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:18.500
I'm sorry.

02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:22.500
I'm sorry.

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:28.500
I'm sorry.

02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:40.500
I'm sorry.

02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:48.500
Honda.

02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:50.500
It's time.

02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:52.500
No.

02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:54.500
They can't stop him.

02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:56.500
You have the power to destroy the stone.

02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:58.500
You must do it.

02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:02.500
We are out of time.

02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:04.500
I can't.

02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:06.500
You can.

02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:10.500
If he gets the stone half the universe dies.

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:16.500
It's not...

02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.500
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:22.500
It's alright.

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:24.500
You could never hurt me.

02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:26.500
I just feel you.

02:06:54.500 --> 02:06:56.500
I'm sorry.

02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:26.500
I'm sorry.

02:08:24.500 --> 02:08:26.500
I'm sorry.

02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:48.500
I understand my child.

02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:50.500
Better than anyone.

02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.500
You could never.

02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:56.500
Today I lost more than you can know.

02:08:56.500 --> 02:09:00.500
But now it's no time to move.

02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:04.500
Now it's no time at all.

02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:06.500
No.

02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:08.500
It's no time at all.

02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:10.500
No.

02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:12.500
It's no time at all.

02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:14.500
No.

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:16.500
It's no time at all.

02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:18.500
No.

02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:20.500
No.

02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:38.500
No.

02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:48.500
No.

02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:18.500
No.

02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:20.500
No.

02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.500
No.

02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:24.500
No.

02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:28.500
No.

02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:30.500
No.

02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:32.500
No.

02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:34.500
No.

02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:36.500
I told you.

02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:40.500
You'd die for that.

02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:42.500
No.

02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:44.500
No.

02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.500
No.

02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:48.500
No.

02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:50.500
No.

02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:52.500
No.

02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:54.500
No.

02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:56.500
No.

02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:58.500
No.

02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:00.500
No.

02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:02.500
No.

02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:06.500
You should have gone for the head.

02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:14.500
You should have gone for the head.

02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:16.500
No.

02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:18.500
No.

02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:20.500
No.

02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:22.500
No.

02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:24.500
What?

02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:26.500
No, no.

02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:28.500
No.

02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:30.500
No.

02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:32.500
Don't cry.

02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:34.500
No.

02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:36.500
No.

02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:38.500
Please...

02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:40.500
Please...

02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:42.500
Don't.

02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:44.500
Don't.

02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:53.500
You could do it.

02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:56.500
Here it is.

02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:06.500
What does it cost?

02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:09.500
Everything.

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:23.500
What did you do?

02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:26.500
What did you do?

02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:39.500
Where'd he go?

02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:45.500
For.

02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:49.500
Where'd he go?

02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:51.500
Steve?

02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:09.500
Steve?

02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:14.500
Steve?

02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:18.500
Steve?

02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:27.500
Up, dude.

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:31.500
This is no place to die.

02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:39.500
Come on.

02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:48.500
Come on.

02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:51.500
No, no, no, no.

02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:53.500
Come on.

02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:09.500
Sam!

02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:15.500
Sam, where are you at?

02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:26.500
Something's happening.

02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:39.500
Come on.

02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:49.500
Stay here, Quil.

02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:56.500
Tony?

02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:01.500
There was no other way.

02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:09.500
Is this start?

02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:15.500
I don't feel so good.

02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:17.500
You're alright.

02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:19.500
I don't know what's happening.

02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:23.500
I don't want to go.

02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:25.500
Please, please.

02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:27.500
I don't want to go.

02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:33.500
Sam.

02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:39.500
You did it.

02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:09.500
What is this?

02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:12.500
What the hell is happening?

02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:35.500
Oh, God.

02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:39.500
I don't want to go.

02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:09.500
I don't want to go.

02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:39.500
I don't want to go.

02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:09.500
I don't want to go.

02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:39.500
I don't want to go.

02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:09.500
I don't want to go.

02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:39.500
I don't want to go.

02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:09.500
I don't want to go.

02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:39.500
I don't want to go.

02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:09.500
I don't want to go.

02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:39.500
I don't want to go.

02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:09.500
I don't want to go.

02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:39.500
I don't want to go.

02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:09.500
I don't want to go.

02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:39.500
I don't want to go.

02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:09.500
I don't want to go.

02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:39.500
I don't want to go.

02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:09.500
I don't want to go.

02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:39.500
I don't want to go.

02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:32.500
I don't want to go.

02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:33.500
Still no words from Stark?

02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:34.500
No, not yet.

02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:37.500
We're watching every satellite on both hemispheres.

02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:38.500
We still know nothing.

02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:39.500
What is it?

02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:41.500
Multiple brigades over Wakanda.

02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:43.500
Same energy signature from New York.

02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:45.500
Ten times bigger.

02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:48.500
Tell Klein we'll meet him in a minute.

02:27:48.500 --> 02:27:49.500
Nick, Nick, Nick!

02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:50.500
Nick, Nick!

02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:51.500
Nick!

02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:05.500
Are you okay?

02:28:05.500 --> 02:28:07.500
There's no one here.

02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:10.500
Carl control.

02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:12.500
Code red.

02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:13.500
Nick!

02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:14.500
Nick!

02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:15.500
Nope!

02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:40.500
Oh no!

02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:43.500
Well done.
